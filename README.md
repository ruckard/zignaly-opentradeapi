# Zignaly OpenTradeApi

## Introduction

This OpenTradeApi should allow you to host a webhook manager that not only accepts webhooks from TradingView but that also run trades in the background with many interesting features.

It's also what [Zignaly](https://zignaly.com) used as a trading webhook system back in the day when they allowed such a feature.

## Community based project

This was an internal project from Highend Technologies LLC which it's also known as [Zignaly](https://zignaly.com) and lately also known as [ZigDAO](https://zigdao.com).

It has been released under the GPLv3 license in 2024.

It is currently maintained by the community so please **do not ask them for fixes or advice**.

## Documentation

Unfortunately the original project lacks documentation on how to setup or use it.
Community will add documentation as needed. You are welcome to contribute towards documentation. Please first open an issue describing what you will be working on so that there is no duplicated work.
